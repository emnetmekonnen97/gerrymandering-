# Gerrymandering Test

This program is a simple tool to detect and visualize gerrymandering in US states. Gerrymandering is the practice of manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts to favor a certain political party. This program uses a text file that contains the names of US states, the number of districts in each state, and the number of Republican and Democratic votes in each district. The program calculates the efficiency gap, a measure of gerrymandering, for each state and displays a bar chart that shows the distribution of votes in each district.

## How to use

To use this program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the program files from this GitHub repository and save them in a folder on your computer. The main file is `gerrymandering.py`, which you can run from the command line or an IDE. The program will ask you to enter the name of a state that you want to analyze. The program will then read the data from the `districts.txt` file and perform the calculations. The program will print the efficiency gap, surplus votes and display the total votes for the state and show a bar chart that compares the votes in each district. You can close the graph window or type `quit` to exit the program.
